#Feature: Edit an existing product in the database
#
#  As a admin
#  I want to edit a product in the DB
#  So that I can update product information or fix mistakes
#
#  Background:
#    Given a vendor already exists
#    And a product already exists
#    And other product tags already exist
#    And I am on the edit product page
#
#  Scenario: Edit page should have information pre-filled for product (happy)
#    Then I should see the product attributes filled in
#    And the product should have its original tags
